- There are no other variables defined in the body of the function. Only the input parameter/variable "x" is present.

Return type:
- The return type of the function is not explicitly specified in the code. However, based on the code logic, it seems that the function returns an element from the "x" array/indexed object. The return type would depend on the type of elements in the "x" object. It could be an int, string, or any other valid data type.
