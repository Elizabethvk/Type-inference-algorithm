user: Giving the following file and the , can you give me the input, the body variables, and the return type of the function from the code?  I mean also types as in int, string and so on. 
fn f(x) { 
    return x[2];
}
assistant: Input: x (array)
Body variables: None
Return type: The type of the element at index 2 of the array x.

fn f(x) { 
    return x*2;
}
assistant: Input: x (type can be any numeric type, such as int, float, etc.)

Body variables: None

Return type: Same as the type of the input x. If x is an int, the return type will be int. If x is a float, the return type will be float.

fn f(b) {
    var x;
    if(b)
    {
        x = "Hello";
    } else {
        x = 3;
    }
    return x;
}
assistant: Input: The input of the function is a single argument "b".

Body Variables: The body of the function defines a variable "x".

Return Type: The return type of the function is dynamic, as it can be either a string or an integer depending on the value of "b".

fn f(b) {
    var x;
    if(b)
    {
        x = "Hello";
    }
    return x;
}
assistant: Input: The input to the function is a variable `b`.

Body variables: There are two body variables in the function:
1. `x` - It is initially undefined.
2. `b` - This variable is passed as input to the function.

Return type: The return type of the function is inferred based on the code. In this case, the return type is `string` since the variable `x` is assigned a string value within the if statement branch ("Hello").

    }
    return f(n-1) + f(n-2);
}
assistant: Input: n (integer)
Body variables: None
Return type: integer

        return m * f(m - 1);
    }
}
assistant: The input of the function `f` is `n` of type int.

The body variables of the function `f` are:
- `n` of type int

The return type of the function `f` is:
- int

The input of the function `g` is `m` of type int.

The body variables of the function `g` are:
- `m` of type int

The return type of the function `g` is:
- int

fn f(x, y)
{
    return (y => f(3, y));
}
assistant: Input: x and y (both variables)
Body Variables: None
Return Type: Function (which takes one argument y and returns the result of calling f(3, y))
